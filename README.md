very much inspired by the [whodle](https://whodle.dixonary.co.uk/) project created by [dixonary](https://twitter.com/dixonary_)! very awesome, be sure to check it out if you're also a Doctor Who nerd :p 

rules are pretty self explanatory and the game is pretty simple but if anyone has any suggestions on what I can change, that would be appreciated
oh and its very easy to cheat by looking at the source code but I personally don't think that's worth preventing, just have fun :)
